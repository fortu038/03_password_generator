# 03_password_generator

## Description

This project was done in order to gain practice with and display skills in JavaScript, such as function calls. The created website
acts as a password generator, taking desired password length and character sets as input from the user. This project allowed me to 
practice using Window methods, such as prompt() and confirm(), and creating functions.

## Installation

## Usage

This website can be used to generate a password of a length greater than or equal to 8 or less than or equal to 128 chars long. To do
so simply click on the red 'Generate Password' button and answer the various pop-ups as they appear on the page. After doing so a password
that follows the user's choosen parameters will appear in the dashed 'Your Secure Password' box.
